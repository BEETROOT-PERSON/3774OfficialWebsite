                    <li>Form an idea: <br>
                        Plan & Explain how it would work + what it would be built with. <br> 
                        Get everyone's opinion, weigh in all the pros & cons and decide on the best ideas presented.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Make it come to life <br>
                        3d model it, sketch it out, make it more than just an idea, but a reality. <br>
                        Once we find a design that everyone agrees on, we implement it on our robot.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Implement: <br>
                        Update our code according to the design and our drivers needs, and solidify the idea as part of our build.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Testing and redesign: <br>
                        Once our designs are ready, we take the bot to the field to test. <br>
                        We ask, Is the design easy to use? Is there anything that could be improved? How reliable is this design long term? How do our drivers feel using this design?
                        If it works and survives all the challenges we throw at it, we move to the next issue at hand. If not, we brainstorm, plan, implement and test again until we find something that works.</li>

                <li>Our engineering team constantly discusses new designs and improvements. We use Onshape, a 3D-modeling software, 
                    to create 3D-printed parts and 1:1 design diagrams for our robot. This online studio serves as a place for blueprints 
                    and experimentation without working with actual parts. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>“If something is not broken, do not fix it.” 3774 takes this principle to heart. We have been reusing our old goBILDA 
                    and Pitsco parts as their quality has been maintained for years; some of our parts are as old as our members!
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Our coding team has a lot to learn and is open to advice. The IDE we use is Android Studios and we use FTC's
                    Java library. If your team is interested in helping us out with any coding advice, feel free to reach out to

                        back to our community and help protect our environment. We also work to ensure that all of the outreach we do 
                        lines up with FIRST ideals. Other responsibilities that fall under nontechnical are fundraising, event 
                        brainstorming, documentation, and team maintenance.

                    <li>3774 participates in the Bayonne Nature Club’s shoreline cleanups every month. During this event, we go to one 
                        of Bayonne’s many shorelines and clean up the trash and debris we find there. We believe that this is a good 
                        way to bond with our team, prioritize the environment, and give back to our community.

                    mission of honoring Bayonne's veterans and preserving local and national military history. We fundraised and 
                    organized an awareness event at the Bergen Point Fall Festival featuring military style games, serving a 
                    dual-purpose of fundraising for the museum and engaging our community. Our informational trifolds encouraged 
                    visits to the museum and spread awareness of our team's missions to the community. Additionally, our members have 
                    volunteered their services to help create a website and social media pages for the museum to reach more people.

                    2023. Project Honeybee is an organization where people can adopt a queen bee and support her hive by purchasing 
                    bee-themed jewelry. Our team has made it an annual tradition to support the project and created Ms. Bumble the Bee 
                    as our mascot, representing our team's ideals and We also give a jewelry piece as a parting gift to rising seniors 
                    as a symbol of our team and values, and as a symbol of gratitude for all their efforts put into the team.
